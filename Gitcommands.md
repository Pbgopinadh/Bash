Git Commands and their explanation:

1.) Git clone -- very basic and intial joining days this git clone copies entire remote/online repository to our computer and also configures the that remote repo in our PC automatically and these remote repository can be seen using git remote -v
2.) Git remove -v -- this is used to see what remote repos like gitlab, github, bitbucket our directory is pushing to.
3.) git push -- pushing the changes we made to a file, folder etc in our computer is being pushed to the remote repo but before this we should commmit the changes.
4.) git commit -m "message about the changes" -- we should commmit the changes made to the files. but, how do i lets say say to git that i only want to commit the changes made to these files
5.) git add . or git add /filename including the path -- this is used to add the files that we are gonna commit. now, i want to make sure that there are no new changes left - how do i see that 
6.) git status -  this is going to show if the changes made are commited or not.
