Bash scripting for automation.

Automation is very easy as we just have to copy and paste the entire commands in a single file and later execute with bash <script-name> its advisable if the bash script has .sh as extension even though it doesnt matter.

Function requirement (FR) : the logic of the code.
Non - functional requiremnet (NFR)

NFR:
1.) the code should be dry (the code/code pattern shouldn't be repeated more than once) if yes then we have to effciently use the code multiple time. lets say funtion/procedures etc.
2.) username and password shouldn't be hardcoded as it is aganist data or security compliance.
3.) the code should run the same or produce the same results when it ran multiple times.

we should follow above 3 when making to create a automation so it is standard, reliable and efficent.
